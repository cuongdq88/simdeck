  caveats <<~EOS
    SimDeck needs the Android SDK (emulator, avdmanager, sdkmanager) and
    Xcode for iOS. Without Android Studio, install the SDK once:
      brew install --cask android-commandlinetools
      sdkmanager "platform-tools" "emulator" "platforms;android-36"
    SimDeck finds the SDK via ANDROID_HOME, else ~/Library/Android/sdk,
    else Homebrew's android-commandlinetools. System images can be
    installed from the app (toolbar > System images).
    If macOS says "SimDeck is damaged", run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/SimDeck.app"
